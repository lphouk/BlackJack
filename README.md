## Gameplay

In this game, you will be playing against the dealer. Your goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Remember that an Ace can count as 1 or 11, and face cards count as 10.

You'll be prompted to decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand). The dealer will also follow the rules to determine their moves.
